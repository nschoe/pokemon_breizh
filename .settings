# This file is a PoKemon Breizh settings file.
# It is program-generated, altering it is not recommended
# You should edit it by hand only if you know what you are doing or
# if you are god, but as such idiocity doesn't exit... well only if you
# know what you are doing!
# Syntax should be pretty easy to guess from the file and won't be explained here
# Obviously, lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments
